  Hi there! I’m a passionate software engineer turned seasoned leader with over a decade of experience in the tech world. I began my journey as a Java/J2EE engineer, ventured into Ruby on Rails, and grew from leading frontend and full-stack teams to managing multiple teams as a Senior Software Engineering Manager.
  
  I have a deep love for technology, architectures, and simplifying complexities—all while keeping a strong business focus. Throughout my career, I’ve built and nurtured high-performing teams, guided them in their growth, and delivered technically complex, multi-team, and high-impact projects. I thrive in dynamic, startup-like environments that challenge me and offer opportunities to learn and grow.

  My expertise spans building web applications, designing backend APIs and microservices, crafting intuitive frontend interfaces, and engineering enterprise-level SaaS solutions. While I’m particularly passionate about creating a positive impact on the environment, I’m open to any domain where I can make a meaningful difference.

  Let’s connect! Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn—I’d love to chat and explore new opportunities.
